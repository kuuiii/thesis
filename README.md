# Traffic Scenario Mining for Safety Validation of Autonomous Vehicle

This repository provides an open-source framework for mining critical traffic scenarios for the purpose of validating autonomous vehicle behavior in simulation environments.

The framework integrates scenario generation, execution, and crash data collection, utilizing Tier IV Scenario Simulator V2, Autoware, and Python. The primary audience is researchers and developers interested in autonomous vehicle safety validation using simulation tools.

## Overview

Autonomous vehicles must be validated in a wide range of traffic scenarios, including rare and high-risk events. This project aims to automate the mining and execution of such scenarios, supporting researchers in identifying and analyzing critical behaviors in simulation.

## Features

- **Scenario Generation:** Automated discovery of challenging and high-risk scenarios.
- **Integrated Simulation:** Uses Tier IV Scenario Simulator V2 and Autoware for realistic testing.
- **Crash Data Collection:** Gathers results and logs for further analysis.
- **Open-source:** Designed for research and educational use.

## Requirements

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Shell
- **Tools:**
  - Docker (with Autoware Universe and ROS2)
  - Tier IV Scenario Simulator V2
  - Tier IV Scenario Editor

## Installation & Usage

> **Note:** Some instructions refer to hardware or directories specific to a university environment. Adapt paths and settings as appropriate for your system.

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuuiii/thesis.git
```

### 2. Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged --env=DISPLAY --env=QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -v /home/autolab/mp_thesis/thesis:/ros2_ws \
  -v /home/autolab/autoware_map:/autoware_map \
  --workdir /ros2_ws mohsen_aw:full bash
```

### 3. Install dependencies inside the Docker container

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y vim
pip3 install setuptools==58.2.0
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/setup.bash
echo "source /autoware/install/setup.bash" >> ~/setup.bash
echo "source /home/iseauto/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/setup.bash
source ~/setup.bash
pip install ruamel.yaml
```

### 4. Source the environment

```bash
. setup.bash
```

### 5. Prepare simulation maps

Copy the `template.yaml` file into the `/autoware_map/` directory:

```bash
cp template.yaml /autoware_map/
```

### 6. Run the experiment

```bash
. run.bash
```

## Scenario Mining Approach

### Mutating Parameters

**Genetic Algorithm Parameters (in** `scenario_utils.py`**)**

These control mutation behavior for evolving scenarios:

```python
mutation_rate = 0.30         # 30% of scenarios mutate each generation
max_delta = 10.0             # max shift in meters (±10 m)
min_delta = 1.0              # min shift to prevent trivial changes
lane_mutation_rate = 0.20    # 20% chance to switch lane IDs
```

- `mutation_rate`: Controls how many scenarios change per generation to explore new failure points.
- `max_delta`: Larger jumps help escape local optima and find diverse scenarios.
- `min_delta`: Prevents tiny ineffective tweaks that clog evolution.
- `lane_mutation_rate`: Introduces topological variety by occasionally swapping lane IDs.

**Examples:**

| Exploration Strategy      | mutation rate | max delta | min delta | lane mutation rate |
|--------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Balanced Exploration     | 0.30          | 10.0      | 1.0       | 0.20              |
| Aggression Exploration   | 0.50          | 15.0      | 2.0       | 0.30              |
| Lane-Focused Exploration | 0.20          | 7.0       | 1.0       | 0.50              |

### Simulation Results

Three different scenario generation methods were tested to evaluate the percentage of collisions:

- **Random scenarios, Ego and NPC start points scattered around the entire intersection:**  
  Out of 1000 randomly generated scenarios, 2% resulted in collisions.

- **Random scenarios, Ego and NPC start points near the intersection:**  
  Out of 1000 randomly generated scenarios, 16% resulted in collisions.

- **Genetic algorithm, optimized scenarios targeting collisions:**  
  Out of 1000 optimized scenarios generated by the genetic algorithm (designed to significantly increase the likelihood of collisions), 41% resulted in collisions.

These results demonstrate that the developed optimization method is effective at discovering high-risk scenarios. Compared to other tested approaches, the proportion of collisions increased by more than 20 times.
