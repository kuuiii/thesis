# Traffic Scenario Mining for Safety Validation of Autonomous Vehicles
This project develops a framework for discovering critical traffic scenarios, specifically high-risk or corner-case events for the purpose of validating autonomous vehicle behavior in simulation environments. Using Tier IV Scenario Simulator V2, Autoware and Python, the system integrates scenario generation, execution and crash data collection.

### Key Features:
- Scenario mining with genetic algorithm (GA)
- Docker-based integration with Autoware + Scenario Simulator

## Tools used:
- Docker
- Autoware Universe
- ROS2
- Tier IV Scenario Simulator V2
- Tier IV Scenario Editor
- Python

## How to Run:
```

```

## Key Results:
- [x] Collision rate increase from 2% â†’ 41% via optimization
